## Using components

To use the components in your app, import them from the [ui package](./packages/ui/).

```tsx
import Button from "@workspace/ui/components/ui/button";
```

You can also create your own component and later export it like the example of [Basic Date Picker](./packages/ui/src/components/ui/basic-date-picker.tsx). Then import it in your application as normal [page.tsx](./apps/client/src/app/page.tsx).

```tsx
import DatePicker from "@workspace/ui/components/ui/basic-date-picker";
```
