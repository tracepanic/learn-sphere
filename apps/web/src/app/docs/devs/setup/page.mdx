# Development Environment Setup

Welcome to Learn Sphere! Our platform is built on a modern stack consisting of
Next.js for the web client and Nest.js for the backend, with PostgreSQL serving
as our database solution.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following tools installed:

### Node.js

Node.js is the JavaScript runtime required to run both Next.js and Nest.js
applications.

- **Installation**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

> [!NOTE]
>
> We currently don't support Bun due to compatibility issues with Nest.js, and
> we haven't tested the application with Deno.

### PNPM

We use PNPM as our package manager for its efficiency and disk space savings.

- **Installation**: [Install PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation)

### PostgreSQL

You'll need access to a PostgreSQL database, either:

- A local PostgreSQL installation
- A remote PostgreSQL instance

[PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

## Getting Started

Once you have installed the prerequisites, you're ready to set up the Learn
Sphere development environment. Follow the instructions in the following
sections to clone the repository, install dependencies, and start the
development servers.

<Steps>

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tracepanic/learn-sphere.git
cd learn-sphere
```

### Create Your Branch

If you plan to contribute to Learn Sphere, we recommend creating your own branch
following a good branching convention:

```bash
git checkout -b <username>/<branch-type>/<description>
```

Examples of branch types:

- `feature/` - For new features
- `fix/` - For bug fixes
- `docs/` - For documentation updates
- `refactor/` - For code refactoring

Example:

```bash
git checkout -b johndoe/feature/user-authentication
```

This convention helps identify who is working on what feature and keeps our
repository organized.

### Install Dependencies

Install all the project dependencies using PNPM:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This command will install dependencies for all packages and applications in the
monorepo.

### Configure Environment

Learn Sphere uses different applications which may require specific
configurations. Make sure to set up your environment variables according to
these guides before proceeding.

  <Cards.Card title="LMS Web Client" href="#" />
  <Cards.Card title="Learn Sphere Website" href="#" />
</Cards>

### Start Development Server

We use Turborepo to manage our monorepo. To start all development servers
simultaneously:

```bash
pnpm turbo dev
```

This will start the development servers for all applications in the monorepo.

### Other Common Commands

Learn Sphere provides several utility commands for development:

#### Code Quality

```bash
# Run linting across all projects
pnpm turbo lint

# Format code with Prettier
pnpm turbo format

# Type check all TypeScript code
pnpm turbo check-types
```

#### Cleaning Up

```bash
# Clean build artifacts and caches
pnpm turbo clean
```

#### Updating Dependencies

```bash
# Update dependencies across all projects
pnpm turbo update
```

</Steps>
